# OBS-Instance-Manager
Manages multiple instances of OBS, for quick setting changes. Useful for streaming on different platforms, or different recording settings. No more typing in everything over and over.

Create and backup multiple 'profiles'.
Profiles contain everything from OBS's settings to plugins and scenes.
I found myself streaming to a platform, needing entirely different resolution settings, scene layouts and more just to go through tons of effort to get it back to settings I'm used to for recording at high quality.
